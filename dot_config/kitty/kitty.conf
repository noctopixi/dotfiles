# Performance tuning {{{
# Delay (in milliseconds) between screen updates. Decreasing it, increases
# frames-per-second (FPS) at the cost of more CPU usage. The default value
# yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient for most uses. Note that to
# actually achieve 100FPS you have to either set sync_to_monitor to no or use a
# monitor with a high refresh rate.
repaint_delay    10

# Delay (in milliseconds) before input from the program running in the terminal
# is processed. Note that decreasing it will increase responsiveness, but also
# increase CPU usage and might cause flicker in full screen programs that
# redraw the entire screen on each loop, because kitty is so fast that partial
# screen updates will be drawn.
input_delay 3

# Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This prevents
# tearing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing) when scrolling. However,
# it limits the rendering speed to the refresh rate of your monitor. With a
# very high speed mouse/high keyboard repeat rate, you may notice some slight input latency.
# If so, set this to no.

# You can combine multiple actions to be triggered by a single shortcut, using the
# syntax below:
# map key combine <separator> action1 <separator> action2 <separator> action3 ...
# For example:
# map ctrl+shift+e combine : new_window : next_layout
